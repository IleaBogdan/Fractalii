# 🌿 Fractalii — A Fractal Generation Project

Welcome to **Fractalii**, a fractal generation project by **Ilea Bogdan** and **Grindean Luca**!

This project was created for our **physics class** using `C#` and **Windows Forms**.

### ✨ Currently Supported Fractals
- 🌳 **Tree Fractal**
- ❄️ **Koch Line & Snowflake Fractals**
- 📈 **Weierstrass Function Fractal**
- 🔺 **Sierpinski Triangle Fractal**

---

### 🚧 What's Next?
We plan to expand our collection and dive into **`GPU programming in C#`** to support:
- 🧠 **Mandelbrot Set**
- 🔬 More complex and computationally intensive fractals

In the meantime, check out our experimental **`JavaScript + WebGL`** version of the Mandelbrot fractal here:
