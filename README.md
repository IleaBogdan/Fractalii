# Fractalii — A Fractal Generation Project

Welcome to **Fractalii**, a fractal generation project by **Ilea Bogdan** and **Grindean Luca**!

This project was created for our **physics class** using `C#` and **Windows Forms**.

### Currently Supported Fractals
- **Tree Fractal**
- **Koch Line & Snowflake Fractals**
- **Weierstrass Function Fractal**
- **Sierpinski Triangle Fractal**

---

### What's Next?
We plan to expand our collection and dive into **`GPU programming in C#`** to support:
- **Mandelbrot Set**
- More complex and computationally intensive fractals

In the meantime, check out our experimental **`JavaScript + WebGL`** version of the Mandelbrot fractal here:
